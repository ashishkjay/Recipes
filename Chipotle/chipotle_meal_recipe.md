# Time of cooking

## Rice

This is your personal preference
I like to use long grain white rice(basmati) for my burrito/bowl

#### Ingredients

- 1 cup Indian basmati rice
- 1-3/4 cups water
- 1-1/2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1/2 teaspoon salt

#### Instructions

- Place the rice in medium bowl and add enough water to cover by 2 inches. Using your hands, gently swish the grains to release any excess starch. Carefully pour off the water, leaving the rice in the bowl. Repeat four times, or until the water runs almost clear. Using a fine mesh strainer, drain the rice.
- In a medium pot, bring the water, butter, salt, and rice to a boil. Cover the pot with a tight fitting lid, then turn the heat down to a simmer and cook for 15 to 20 minutes, until all of the water is absorbed and the rice is tender.
- If the rice is still too firm, add a few more tablespoons of water and continue cooking for a few minutes more. Remove the pan from the heat and allow it to sit covered for 5 minutes. Fluff the rice with a fork and serve.

## Guac

Again this is all upto your preference, ther will be plenty left over

#### Ingredients

- 3 Avocados
- 1 lime
- salt and pepper
- 1 Jalepeno
- A little bit of chopped cilantro
- a bit of minced red onion

#### Instructions

## Cooking chicken/steak

You can grill them or bake them but as long as it reaches optimal cooked interal temp, you are good!

#### Serve as a bowl or make a burrito with large enough tortillas

- If you like a soft tortilla like chipotle, you can do this ->
  - In the microwave topped with a damp paper towel for 10-20 seconds depending on how how soft you like the tortilla. This will allow the tortilla to stretch a little bit more while wrapping.
