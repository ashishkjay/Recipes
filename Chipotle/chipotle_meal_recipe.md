# Chipotle Meal

#### This is an EZPZ DIY Chipotle recipe after many iterations of getting it as close to the real deal as possible. I was able to procure ingredients for this due to chipotle being very "open" about their ingredients. \*\* The rice steps is copy pasted based on a highly rated recipe.

### Optional ingredients to procure is sour cream/cheese/corn if you fancy them

# Pre cooking prep

## For the marinade (chicken or steak)

#### Ingredients

- 4 cloves garlic
- 7 oz adobo sauce whole can (You can find thes in the HISPANIC Isle of any store called [CHIPOTLE PEPPERS IN ADOBO SAUCE]
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 teaspoons cumin powder
- 2 teaspoons dried oregano
- Salt and ground black pepper
- 2 teaspoon dried Ancho Chilli power(optional since its hard to find)

#### Instructions

- Blend all of these ingredients in the blender (make sure you have enough salt).
- In a mixing bowl, mix in 4-5 chicken breasts/steak let it marinate minimum 4 hours to a whole day.

## Sauce

I only have the hot sauce version.
I used to make this from scratch by roasting tomatillos/garlic in the oven and boiling them. It's a long arduous process.

Here is an EZPZ option. Buy this from Target!
