- Mix the blended Panade and the ground beef from the fridge in a mixing bowl really nicely 
- Make out patties to ensure they are 4-6oz. Depress the center of each burger patty to ensure they don't get thick in the center. While cooking a burger you want the center thinner.
- Place your patties on the grill for roughly 3-4 minutes(DO NOT MOVE|DO NOT TOUCH).
- Flip burger after the 3-4 minutes and let cook on the other side until you feel it's cooked to your preference.
- NOTE: Do not move, do not push. Let the burger stay juicy 
- Take off the grill and let it sit for 5 minutes 
- While the burger is resting, on the side of the grill or on a hot skillet, quickly toast buttered hamburger buns to have a nice toasted browning
- Apply your aioli sauce, your patty, and toppings, serve with your choice of side
