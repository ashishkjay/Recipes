Ingredients:

oil, for frying
Maida (white flour), 1 cup
Rice Flour, 1/4 cup
Salt, to taste
baking soda, 1/2 tsp
buttermilk, 1/4-1/2 cup (I don’t bother measure, I pour directly from the jug)
cumin seeds, 1/2 tsp
green chilis, 1-2 diced
coconut unsweetened, 1 tbsp diced small (optional)
coriander leaves, 1 tbsp chopped
Directions:

Add white flour, rice flour, salt, and baking soda and mix in a large bowl. Gradually add buttermilk while mixing by hand. Gently mix. Do not knead. You want it to look like this.



Let the batter sit for around 10 minutes. Add the rest of the ingredients and stir. Cover and let sit for 1 hour. Resting the batter will produce a soft bonda.



Heat frying oil on medium high or just below medium high. Test the temp by taking a pinch of the batter and putting it into the oil. The oil is ready if the batter quickly floats to the top. Wet your hand , and take about a ping pong ball size and cradle the mixture in your fingers and drop into oil. You can add more than one at a time. The balls should turn themselves into the shape of a ball, and will probably turn themselves over while cooking. If they don’t, that’s ok too. Cook till golden brown.
